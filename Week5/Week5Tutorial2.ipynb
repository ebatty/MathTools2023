Instead, we bin time and estimate the spatial receptive field for that small span of time. In this case, we will bin time into 10 ms bins. So we have the spatial receptive field from 10-0 ms ago, 20-10 ms ago, 30-20 ms ago, etc. For this retinal neuron, the size of our receptive field is 25 x 20 x 20, where the first dimension (25) is the temporal component and corresponds to 10 ms bins.

In fact, it is possible that we can well approximate the full spatiotemporal receptive field as the same spatial receptive field that is just weighted differently at every point in time.

In practice, this will never be the case with receptive fields as there will be some noise so you will not be able to perfectly reconstruct with just two vectors and the the first singular value will not be the only non-zero one. However, you can still look at the values of the singular values to assess separability: if the first singular value is far higher than the rest, the receptive field is pretty well approximated by a single temporal filter and a single spatial receptive field. You can validate from the plot below that this is the case with the receptive field we've been working with."

Note that this is not the only case in which you can use SVD to parse the receptive field, just the most obvious/most intuitive one.  Anytime you have a receptive field formed from two different types of information (time vs space in this case), you can use this method to assess the separability of the receptive field into two distinct filters that each operate on one of the types of information. As a perhaps silly example, you could have a receptive field of a neuron in actual space based on the animals position (like for a place cell) where the two types of information are two axes of space (north-south, east-west). You could determine whether this receptive field is separable, meaning that the neuron has a single east-west filter and a single north-south filter and the neuron responds as the sum of the activation of each of these filters."
