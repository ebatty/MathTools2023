We will use tSNE to visualize our data in 2D space. tSNE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique often used to visualize high d data in low d space. It is also a bit controversial in the scientific community. I'm not that caught up on the tSNE debate (and rarely use it) but the gist is that tSNE plots are often misinterpreted and depend on a hyperparameter that you set - check out this[ article ](https:////distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) and [this one](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) for more details.\n",

        "\n",
        "Another thing to keep in mind with tSNE is that, like clustering, it's not great at dealing with really high D space. This is a little confusing since that is the whole point of tsne - to convert high d to low d. It's pretty good at converting 10-d space for example to 2-d space but not at converting 32738-d space to 2-d space. Because of this, even when we use tSNE to visualize, we often perform PCA first. So a common pipeline is 1) Perform PCA and cast to ~20-d space, 2) Perform tSNE to cast to 2 or 3-d space. Here, we will use our pca data as the input for tSNE.\n"
